distributed design on the FASTory line

This task is an assignment for Distributed Automation System Design course.

The FASTory simulator is also online at escop.rd.tut.fi:3000/fmw with a
description of its API.

This task was done with a local simulator running on TCP port 3000. 
Their REST API is similar to that of the real assembly line, 
which is located in Tampere University of Technology's Factory Automation 
Systems and Technologies (FAST) laboratory. (www.tut.fi/fast)
